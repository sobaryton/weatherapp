This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Assumptions

The API returns a list of weather information for 5 days every 3 hours.
I will display for each day only the weather for the hours between 12pm - 3pm.
Doing an average on the day won't be so accurate, as during the night the temperature can fall down.
